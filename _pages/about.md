Hi! I am a second-year CS Ph.D. student at the <a href='https://umd.edu/'>University of Maryland, College Park</a>, where I am honored to be advised by <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ugFNit4AAAAJ&hl=en'>Professor Ming C. Lin</a> at <a href='https://gamma.umd.edu/'>GAMMA Lab</a>. My current research focuses on the intersection of world models, Vision-Language Models (VLMs), and robot learning, unified through adaptive sampling methods to achieve sample-efficient learning in sequential decision-making tasks. I'm also actively exploring Vision-Language Action models (VLAs) and their potential applications in real-world problems such as autonomous driving.

Before starting my Ph.D., I had the opportunity to work on various exciting <a href='https://ai4science.caltech.edu/'>AI4Science</a> topics, including Physics-Informed ML for Extreme Weather Events with <a href='https://www.leiw.org/about'>Professor Lei Wang</a> at <a href='https://www.purdue.edu/'>Purdue University</a>, Machine Learning in High-Energy Astrophysics with <a href='https://science.gsfc.nasa.gov/sci/bio/abderahmen.zoghbi'>Dr. Abderahmen Zoghbi</a> at <a href='https://www.nasa.gov/goddard/'>NASA Goddard Space Flight Center</a>, and Geospatial AI with <a href='https://geog.umd.edu/facultyprofile/xie/yiqun'>Professor Yiqun Xie</a> at University of Maryland.

I’m always open to potential collaborations, research discussions, and new opportunities. Please feel free to reach out if you’re interested in my works or would like to collaborate on potential projects!
